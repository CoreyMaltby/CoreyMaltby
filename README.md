## Corey Maltby

I am studying Bsc computing at Solent University in Southampton, UK.

Currently, I am doing modules on:
* Research Methods
* Human Computer Interaction
* Web Application Development
* Advanced Database Systems
* Object-oriented design and Development
* Analytics and Business Intelligence

These modules have helped me develop my skills with Python, HTML, React, SQL, Kotlin, object-oriented programming, UX, researching and project management.
