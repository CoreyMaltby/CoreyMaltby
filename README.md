I am studying Bsc computing at Solent University in Southampton, UK.

Currently, I am doing modules on:
- Research Methods
- Human Computer Interaction
- Web Application Development
- Advanced Database Systems
- Object Orientated Design and Development
- Analytics and Business Intelligence

These modules have helped me develop my skills with Python, HTML, React, SQL, Kotlin, object-oriented programming, UX, researching and project management.
